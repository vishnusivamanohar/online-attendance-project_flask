# Online Attendance System 🚀

## Description  
This project implements a web-based attendance management system — enabling teachers to record and manage student attendance online instead of using traditional paper-based methods. It features a clean frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) and a backend powered by Flask + MySQL.  

The system supports: adding/removing students, marking attendance per period, viewing attendance records, calculating attendance percentage, and sending email notifications to all or selected students. It’s designed to make attendance processes easier, faster, and more organized.
