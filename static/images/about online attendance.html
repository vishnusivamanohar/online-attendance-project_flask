        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>
            Nowadays, everything is moving online, so why shouldn't attendance be online too? Let's make it happen!
            This website is designed for teachers to record student attendance online instead of using traditional methods. To access the website, you must enter a password. If the password is correct, you will be redirected to the homepage.

            This website mainly consists of five pages:<br>

        <h2>Working of the wedsite:</h2>
        <p>
            This website includes both frontend and backend development.<br>
            The entire frontend is built using HTML and CSS, providing a structured layout and styling for a user-friendly experience.<br>
            For the backend, I used Flask, a Python-based web framework that handles the logic and communication between the user interface and the database.<br>
            The database is created using MySQL, which stores all the necessary data for the website.<br>
            <b>How It Works:</b><br>
            When a user interacts with the website, the provided data is stored in the MySQL database.<br>
            Flask acts as a bridge between the database and the frontend, retrieving and displaying the necessary information dynamically.<br>
            The Flask application runs in the background as a server, handling requests, processing data, and ensuring smooth communication between different components.<br>
            <img src="app.PNG" alt="View Attendance" width="900">
            This combination of HTML, CSS, Flask, and MySQL ensures an efficient, responsive, and interactive online attendance system.<br>
